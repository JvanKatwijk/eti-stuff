//
//	A convenience class for the use of the functionality of the
//	dab -> eti library.
//	The class combined the functionality of the ofdmProcessor class
//	and the etiGenerator class
//	The ofdmProcessor class does - as the name suggests - the 
//	ofdm handling, the raw decoded ofdm blocks are passed on to
//	the etiGenerator class. The latter does the interpretation
//	and the translation to eti format.
//
//	Communication with the "outside" world is through some callbacks
//	a. the syncsignal_t syncsignalHandler is called (once) to
//	indicate whether or not the software could time synchronize
//	in which case it is assumed there is a DAB signal
//	b. the snrsignal_t snrsignalHandler  is called app once a second
//	it tells a rought SNR.
//	c. the ensemblename_t ensembleHandler is called whenever the
//	name of an ensemble is detected. The general idea is that when
//	such a name is detected, the frequency synchronization is OK
//	and the process of update frequency synchronization can be stopped.
//	The function migh be called several times.
//	d. the programname_t programNameHandler is called whenever the
//	name of a program in the ensemble is detected.
//	e. the fibquality_t fibqualityHandler tells the percentage of
//	fib blocks that successfully passed the crc test.
//	the etiwriter_t	etiwriterHandler is called whever the eti processing
//	is on, it just hands over the eti frames. The current setup is unbuffered.
