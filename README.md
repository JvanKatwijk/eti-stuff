# eti-stuff

"eti-stuff" is an attempt to understand the eti structure as defined in ETS 300 799.

[eti-backend](#eti-backend) is based on [Qt-DAB](https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/qt-dab), with code included from [dabtools](https://github.com/Opendigitalradio/dabtools) to actually decode the eti frames.

[eti-cmdline](#eti-cmdline) is based on the dab-cmdline software  with code
included from [dabtools](https://github.com/Opendigitalradio/dabtools) to actually decode the eti frames.
It is - as the name suggests - a command line version.

When constructing, select the input device of choice in the CMake command
(current supported are SDRplay, AIRspy, DABsticks, ".sdr" and ".iq" files)

By piping the output from eti-cmdline into eti-backend, a more or less complete DAB receiver exists.

## eti-backend

which is a stripped Qt-DAB version that takes eti-frames as input. A command line option (`-s`) can be used to specify an input file or stdinput. If none is specified, the program will show a widget for selecting an input file.
   
The GUI is simple, it will show the name of the ensemble and the names of programs. Selecting a program is as in the Qt-DAB software. 

It will start reading after pressing the start button.

Build eti-backend using the qmake/make commands

### eti-cmdline-exp  is a version being experimented with (the name suggests this).
It will try to insert missing frames as null frames, starting with an error
code 0 (i.e. non repairable).

### Syntax

If you want to emulate a full DAB receiver, then run

      eti-cmdline-xxx -C 11C -G 80 | eti-backend -s -
      
Or you can use dablin or dablin_gtk from https://github.com/Opendigitalradio/dablin by running
      
      eti-cmdline-xxx -C 11C -G 80 | dablin_gtk
      
where xxx refers to the input device being supported, one of (`rtlsdr`, `sdrplay`, `airspy`, `rawfiles`, `wavfiles`).
